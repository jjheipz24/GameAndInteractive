in teams of 3-4 to create one game to present at the end of the academy. My team was made up of four people: an artist, a game designer, and
two programmers. Together we made a game called "Mini Savage: Golf Edition", which features a golf ball that is controlled by the player in a
fast-paced obstacle course type game. This game was made in Unity and programmed using the language C#.

	The artwork of the home page and the controls page, the modeling of the club, golf ball, flag, and mat were all done by our artist.
The level design of the courses were done by our game designer. All of the programming aspects, from the movement of the club; the player
controls; the "loser meter"; the sound; the interaction of the buttons; etc., were completed by myself and the other programmer in our 
group, with assistance from the TAs and RAs that were there. 

	Enjoy!

** The game can be played by clicking on the .exe file in the "GolfGame" folder. There is a folder that features solely some screencaps of
the game. In the folder "Code Files", there are the scripts used in the game as CS files. Within that folder, there is another folder titled
"Game Code", which contains all of the code as easily viewable PDFs **
